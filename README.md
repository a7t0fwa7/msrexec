# msrexec

msrexec is a small project that can be used to elevate arbitrary MSR writes to kernel execution on 64 bit Windows-10 systems. This project is part of the VDM (vulnerable driver manipulation) namespace
and can be integrated into any prior VDM projects. Although this project falls under the VDM namespace, Voyager and bluepill can be used to provide arbitrary wrmsr writes.
